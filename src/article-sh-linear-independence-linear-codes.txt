In this article I describe a fascinating connection between [[shallowly linearly independent sets|toggle:sli]]
and [[linear codes|toggle:linear codes]].

_ sli
    Two years ago, my friend Kolja stated an interesting problem. Let $V \coloneqq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ be the vector space of 
    binary words of length $n$. For $k\in \mathbb{N}$, how large a subset $M \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ can we find such
    that every subset $A\subseteq M$ of size $\le k$ is linearly independent?
    
    I have investigated this problem in a [[writeup|https://github.com/datokrat/shallow-linear-independence/blob/master/lokal-linear-unabh%C3%A4ngig.pdf]] in German and propose to call such sets shallowly linearly independent or, more specific, linearly $k$-independent.

_ linear codes
    A linear code is a concept from computer science. It is a linear subspace $M \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ of so-called codewords (adding two words means xor-ing them). $M$ is isomorphic to the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^{\dim M}$, and that's why a linear code $M$ can be used to represent binary words of length $\dim M$. Although the encoded words might be longer, some codes have interesting error-correction properties, and that's the technology we all know from barcodes and CR codes.

The central observation is that while linear independence means that there are no non-trivial linear combinations of the zero vector, liner $k$-independence means that there are no non-trivial linear combinations with at most $k$ vectors involved. It is easier to see what is going on after formalizing this relationship a bit. Given $M \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$, write all vectors of $M$ into the rows of a large matrix $A_M$ with dimensions $\#M \times n$. Feel free to explore an [[example|toggle:matrix example]].

_ matrix example
    Consider, for example, $$M = \{ 1000, 0100, 0010, 0001, 1111 \}.$$
    Then $$A_M = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.$$

Now, linear combinations of zero are exactly those $v \in \mathbb{F}_2^{\# M}$ with $v^\top A_M = 0$, and the number of ones in $v$ (the Hamming weight) equals the number of vectors involved in the linear combination ([[example|toggle:linear combination example]]).

_ linear combination example
    In the example above, the smallest nontrivial linear combination of zero is $$ 1000 + 0100 + 0010 + 0001 + 1111 = 0.$$
    This linear combination is represented by the vector $ 11111 $, and the fact that it is a linear combination of zero
    can be expressed as $$ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$

In other words, the set of linear combinations of zero in M equals the kernel of $A^\top$, and by the dimension formula, we obtain
$$ \dim \left<M\right> + \dim \ker A^\top = \# M. $$
